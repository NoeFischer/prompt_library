# Prompt Collection

A collection of prompts for Language Learning Models (LLMs), with each prompt organized in its own folder.

## Structure

- Each folder in this repository represents a single prompt.
- A folder may contain:
  - The main prompt file (.md)
  - Additional files for the prompt's knowledge base (if applicable); either the actual files or scripts to generate them.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the folder of the prompt you're interested in.
2. Open the main prompt file.
3. If present, review any knowledge base files in the same folder.
4. Copy the prompt text and any necessary information from the knowledge base.
5. Paste the prompt (and any additional context) into your preferred LLM interface.

## Compatibility

These prompts are designed to be compatible with various LLMs but mostly tested with the most advanced Anthropic and OpenAI model. Adapt as needed for your specific model or use case.
